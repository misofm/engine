# Research: default ramp lengths for live mute, fader and pan changes (cited, measured, listened)

Owner ruling (2026-09-28): the defaults for the session's `controlSmoothing` settings are chosen from evidence, not a rule of thumb. The proposed starting point is about 5 ms for mute/solo and about 20 ms for fader and pan moves; this research confirms or replaces it. AGENTS.md's evidence rules apply (primary citations, fixtures, objective tests, listening evidence).

## Questions

1. **What do others do?** From official documentation only: mute, solo and fader/pan smoothing or declick times in at least two production DAWs (for example Logic, Ableton Live, Pro Tools) and at least two digital consoles (for example DiGiCo, SSL, Yamaha), plus common plugin frameworks' parameter-smoothing guidance. Cite each; say where nothing is documented.
2. **Objective measurement.** On realistic material (a bass note, a kick, a full mix), measure the click energy of a mute at 0, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 ms, and the zipper of a fader drag with control updates at 30 and 60 Hz, for each ramp length. Use the engine's own fader, mute and matrix ramps.
3. **Listening.** Prepare a short blinded comparison packet the owner can run (mute click, drag smoothness, responsiveness), following the repository's listening-evidence conventions.

## Output

`docs/handoffs/control-smoothing-defaults/` with the citations, the measurements (committed script and data) and the listening packet, and a recommended default table for the `controlSmoothing` issue. No product code change.
